# Status Update Dec. 10

### What we did this week

We finished the implementation of the single player version of the game. Rules now pop up depending on which card is drawn. We also updated the home page of the site, and added a welcome screen.

### Challenges we faced

We struggled with prioritization this week, spending an inordinate amount of time attempting to fix styling rules when our app is far from complete.

### Goals for the coming week

To finish by Tuesday, we will be attempting to implement multiplayer on Saturday, and then using the node server to send notifications when someone's turn is up. If multiplayer turns out to not be feasible to complete by Tuesday, we will stick with single player and implement other features like saving the results of games and sending emails to invite other people to try the game.

* " spending an inordinate amount of time attempting to fix styling rules when our app is far from complete." => priorities.  Styling comes last as it is always subject to changes.
* "we will stick with single player and implement other features like saving the results of games and sending emails to invite other people to try the game. " => a good plan.
