1. What Was Accomplished This Week: 
		-Using phaser.io, we created a game board that has a randomized board of
		 52 cards laid out, face down, that when clicked flip over. The cards are from a spritesheet.
		-We styled this page
		-We created a home page that links to the game page
		-We used W3.CSS as a front-end framework for this

2. Challenges:
		-Figuring out how to use a spritesheet (as opposed to individual images) for cards in phaser.io
		-Figuring out how to get the card back to appear properly from the spritesheet

3. Goals for Next Week: 
		-Having one card you click on, that pulls a randomized, non-repeating card
		 and then goes away when you click it again.
		-Further developing the front-end to generally look better and have access 
		 other game options.

* Phaser.io too? Cool. This sounds very exciting.
* Is http://webkingz.herokuapp.com/ still being used?
